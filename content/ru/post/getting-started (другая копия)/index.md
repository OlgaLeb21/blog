## My week

There were several holidays this week.
One of them is Victory Day. This is a celebration of the victory of the Red Army and the Soviet people over Nazi Germany in the Great Patriotic War of 1941-1945. On this day, a parade was held on Red Square and a beautiful bright fireworks display was launched.

My relatives came to me in Moscow and we visited many amazing places, for example, Tsaritsino Park, or the Claude Monet exhibition. Everyone really enjoyed it and we had a great time together.

We also learned a lot this week. We did a lot of laboratory work, improved our skills in c++, arduno.
