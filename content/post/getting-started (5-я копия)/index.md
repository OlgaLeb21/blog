title: Report design
subtitle: Teaching practice for a student is a common thing. Many perceive it as another adventure. Some take it quite seriously and hope to gain invaluable experience. And here's the surprise - most often, expectations are not justified. But this does not negate the fact that students will have to somehow decide how to write a practice report.

## Design

- - - 

Despite the presence of its own requirements at each university, which can be found in the methodological literature of your university, there are standards for preparing a practice report: 

The total amount of work does not exceed 40 sheets of standard A4 format. 

The practice report is numbered on all pages (except for the title page and the appendix to the practice work). 

The text of the work is printed in black type Times New Roman 12-14 pt. Between the lines set double or one and a half spacing. 

The indent from the new line is 1.25 pt. 

Each section has its own title. The new section starts on a new line. 

Before starting to create a document, acceptable page indents are set: 30 mm on the left margin, 20 mm on the right margin, 20 mm indent above and below. 

When preparing a report on practice according to GOST, it is unacceptable to transfer words. However, many university departments allow word wrapping, so check this point with your department. 

If you study at a technical university, you may need a frame for the report.
